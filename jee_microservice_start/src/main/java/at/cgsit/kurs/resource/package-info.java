/**
 * This package contains the resource classes for the REST API.
 * <p>
 * In Java and Spring-based projects, these classes are often called <code>controllers</code>,
 * inspired by the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, where they act as the entry point for HTTP requests.
 * <p>
 * In RESTful architectures, however, the term <strong>resource</strong> is more semantically correct,
 * as each class represents a REST resource (e.g. /users, /orders).
 * <p>
 * Other naming variations sometimes used:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>rest</code> – a generic prefix or package for all REST interfaces</li>
 *   <li><code>endpoint</code> – emphasizes the technical interface, often used in generated code</li>
 *   <li><code>handler</code> – sometimes used in functional or event-driven approaches</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Following RESTful conventions, this package uses the <code>resource</code> naming pattern.
